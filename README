Chatter Box is a simple chatting application built with the purpose of furthering my skills as a web developer. Enter any user name and click log in to get started. You may also open this application in a separate window and log in as another user to test the application's functionality with multiple users.

This application uses some of the following technologies:

Node.JS
Express
Socket.IO
Validator
Bootstrap
JQuery
